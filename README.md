To get started with the project files, you'll need to:
* Install Jupyter on [Windows](https://jupyter.org/install), [Mac](https://jupyter.org/install), [Linux](https://jupyter.org/install)
* Install Python on [Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), [Mac](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/), [Linux](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/)
* Install TensorFlow 2.0 on [Windows](https://www.tensorflow.org/install), [Mac](https://www.tensorflow.org/install), [Linux](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)

## About The Deep Learning Workshop
With [The Deep Learning Workshop](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Workshop-next-generation-TensorFlow-ebook/dp/B08Q8GP7DJ/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=The%20Deep%20Learning%20Workshop&qid=1611054533&sr=8-2&utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=Repository&utm_campaign=9781801075169&utm_term=Deep%20Learning&utm_content=The%20Deep%20Learning%20Workshop), youâ€™ll learn about essential deep learning concepts, such as image recognition, text embedding, and neural networks, all so that you can build your own smart machine learning models. You'll be able to learn at your own pace with the help of interesting activities and hands-on exercises that will keep you hooked throughout the book.	

## What you will learn
* Understand how deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are different
* Develop multilayer deep neural networks with TensorFlow
* Implement deep neural networks for multiclass classification using Keras
* Train CNN models for image recognition
* Handle sequence data and use it in conjunction with RNNs
* Build a GAN to generate high-quality synthesized images
